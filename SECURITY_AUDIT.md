# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

**Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**

The B2B portal has a major security vulnerability where authenticated users can access data from ALL companies, not just their own company. This is a critical data exposure issue that violates multi-tenancy security principles.

**Affected Areas**:
- Orders API (`/api/orders`)
- Invoices API (`/api/invoices`)
- Quotes API (`/api/quotes`)
- Company data API
- All user-facing data endpoints

---

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. 🔴 CRITICAL: Missing Authentication Middleware

**Location**: `server/routes.ts` lines 320, 475, and most data endpoints

**Issue**:
```typescript
// ❌ VULNERABLE - No authentication middleware
app.get("/api/orders", async (req, res) => {
  const userToken = getUserToken(req);  // Just extracts header, no validation
  const response = await bigcommerce.getOrders(userToken, ...);
  // ...
});
```

**Problem**:
- Endpoints do NOT use `authenticateToken` middleware
- No JWT token verification
- No validation that the request is from an authenticated user
- Anyone can send requests with any `Authorization` header

**Impact**: **CRITICAL**
- Unauthenticated users could potentially access data
- No server-side validation of user identity

---

### 2. 🔴 CRITICAL: No Company-Based Authorization

**Location**: All data endpoints

**Issue**:
- JWT tokens contain `companyId` but it's never checked
- No middleware to verify user belongs to requested company
- No filtering of data by company ID at the server level

**Problem**:
```typescript
// JWT payload has companyId
interface JWTPayload {
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  companyId?: string;  // ✅ Present in token
  role?: string;
}

// But endpoints don't verify it!
app.get("/api/orders", async (req, res) => {
  // ❌ No check if req.user.companyId matches the data being returned
  const response = await bigcommerce.getOrders(userToken, ...);
  res.json(response);  // Returns ALL orders!
});
```

**Impact**: **CRITICAL**
- User from Company A can see orders/invoices from Company B, C, D, etc.
- Complete breach of multi-tenancy
- Data exposure violation
- Potential compliance issues (GDPR, etc.)

---

### 3. 🟠 HIGH: Dual Token Confusion

**Issue**:
The system uses TWO different types of tokens:

1. **JWT Access Token** (generated by our server)
   - Contains: userId, email, companyId, role
   - Used in `/api/auth/login` response
   - Should be used for authentication

2. **BigCommerce User Token** (from BigCommerce OAuth)
   - Contains: BigCommerce session data
   - Used in `Authorization` header
   - Passed to BigCommerce API

**Problem**:
- Code extracts "userToken" from header without validating it's our JWT
- No verification that the BigCommerce token belongs to the authenticated user
- Potential for token substitution attacks

**Current Flow** (VULNERABLE):
```
1. User logs in → Gets JWT + BigCommerce token
2. Frontend sends requests with BigCommerce token in header
3. Server extracts token WITHOUT validation
4. Server passes token to BigCommerce API
5. BigCommerce returns data (but which company's data?)
```

**Secure Flow** (NEEDED):
```
1. User logs in → Gets JWT + BigCommerce token stored server-side
2. Frontend sends requests with JWT in header
3. Server validates JWT → Extracts userId + companyId
4. Server retrieves BigCommerce token for this user from storage
5. Server makes BigCommerce API call with user's token
6. Server filters response by user's companyId
7. Return ONLY data belonging to user's company
```

---

### 4. 🟠 HIGH: Missing Authorization Layer

**Issue**:
- No role-based access control (RBAC) enforcement
- `requireRole()` middleware exists but is NOT used on data endpoints
- No permission checks for sensitive operations

**Missing Checks**:
- Can user view this order?
- Can user modify this invoice?
- Can user see company-wide data?
- Can admin access other companies' data?

---

### 5. 🟡 MEDIUM: No Data Ownership Verification

**Issue**:
When accessing specific resources like `/api/orders/:id`, there's no check that the order belongs to the user's company:

```typescript
app.get("/api/orders/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const userToken = getUserToken(req);
  const response = await bigcommerce.getOrder(userToken, req.params.id);
  res.json(response);  // ❌ No verification!
});
```

**Problem**:
- User can access ANY order by ID if they guess/know the ID
- No validation that order.companyId === user.companyId

---

### 6. 🟡 MEDIUM: Incomplete Session Tracking

**Issue**:
- Session timeout implemented but not enforced on data endpoints
- `sessionTimeout` middleware exists but not used
- User sessions not properly tracked across requests

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened:

1. **Over-reliance on BigCommerce**: The code assumes BigCommerce will handle all authorization, but:
   - BigCommerce may not have proper multi-tenant filtering
   - We need to add our own authorization layer for security

2. **Missing Middleware Chain**: Data endpoints don't use security middleware:
   ```typescript
   // Should be:
   app.get("/api/orders",
     authenticateToken,    // ✅ Verify JWT
     sessionTimeout,       // ✅ Check session
     requireCompanyAccess, // ✅ Verify company access
     async (req, res) => {
       // ...
     }
   );
   ```

3. **No Server-Side Filtering**: Even if BigCommerce returns all data, our server should filter it:
   ```typescript
   const orders = await bigcommerce.getOrders(userToken);

   // ✅ Filter by user's company
   const filteredOrders = orders.filter(order =>
     order.companyId === req.user.companyId
   );

   res.json(filteredOrders);
   ```

- Potential exposure of:
  - Order history and amounts
  - Invoice details and payment status
  - Company names and contact information
  - Pricing information
  - Product purchase patterns
  - Custom fields and ERP data

### Compliance Risk: **HIGH**

- GDPR violations (unauthorized data access)
- PCI DSS concerns (if payment data exposed)
- SOC 2 compliance issues
- Data privacy regulations

### Business Risk: **HIGH**

- Loss of customer trust
- Potential legal liability
- Competitive intelligence exposure
- Contract violations with BigCommerce

1. **Add Authentication Middleware to ALL data endpoints**
   - Use `authenticateToken` on every protected route
   - Verify JWT tokens properly

2. **Implement Company-Based Authorization**
   - Create `requireCompanyAccess` middleware
   - Filter all data by `req.user.companyId`

3. **Server-Side Data Filtering**
   - Always filter BigCommerce responses by companyId
   - Never trust client-side filtering

4. **Audit All Endpoints**
   - Review every API route
   - Add security middleware
   - Test with different company users

### Short-Term Actions (Priority 2 - HIGH)

5. **Implement Role-Based Access Control**
   - Use `requireRole()` middleware
   - Define permission matrix
   - Admin vs. Buyer vs. Viewer roles

6. **Add Resource Ownership Checks**
   - Verify data belongs to user's company
   - Check permissions for specific resources

7. **Improve Token Management**
   - Store BigCommerce tokens server-side
   - Map JWT userId to BigCommerce token
   - Invalidate tokens on logout

### Medium-Term Actions (Priority 3 - MEDIUM)

8. **Add Audit Logging**
   - Log all data access
   - Track which users access what data
   - Alert on suspicious access patterns

9. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent brute force attacks
   - Limit API calls per user/company

10. **Security Testing**
    - Penetration testing
    - Automated security scans
    - Code review process

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing:

1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation Test**:
   ```
   1. Create User A in Company X
   2. Create User B in Company Y
   3. Login as User A
   4. Try to access User B's data
   5. Should FAIL with 403 Forbidden
   ```

2. **Authentication Test**:
   ```
   1. Make API request without token
   2. Should return 401 Unauthorized
   3. Make request with invalid token
   4. Should return 403 Forbidden
   ```

3. **Authorization Test**:
   ```
   1. Login as buyer role
   2. Try to access admin-only endpoint
   3. Should return 403 Forbidden
   ```

### Automated Testing:

```typescript
describe('Security Tests', () => {
  it('should not allow access without authentication', async () => {
    const res = await request(app).get('/api/orders');
    expect(res.status).toBe(401);
  });

  it('should not allow cross-company data access', async () => {
    const tokenCompanyA = generateTestToken({ companyId: 'A' });
    const tokenCompanyB = generateTestToken({ companyId: 'B' });

    // Create order for Company A
    const order = await createTestOrder({ companyId: 'A' });

    // Try to access with Company B token
    const res = await request(app)
      .get(`/api/orders/${order.id}`)
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${tokenCompanyB}`);

    expect(res.status).toBe(403);
  });
});
```
