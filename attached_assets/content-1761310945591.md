## Create a Company Address [Permalink for this section](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/b2b-edition/apis/rest-management/address/addresses\#create-a-company-address)

POSThttps://api-b2b.bigcommerce.com/api/v3/io/addresses

#### Request

Creates an address for a Company account. Use [Bulk Create Addresses](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/b2b-edition/apis/rest-management/address/addresses#bulk-create-addresses) to create multiple addresses in a single request.

## Considerations [Permalink for this section](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/b2b-edition/apis/rest-management/address/addresses\#considerations)

In addition to the minimum-required fields presented in the request body example, you may need to supply a `stateName` or a `stateCode` if the address is in a [designated country](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/b2b-edition/apis/rest-management/address/addresses#get-a-state).

If you have set one or more address extra fields as mandatory, you must include the `extraFields` object in the request body. If an extra field is configured to accept only unique values, each `fieldValue` must be distinct for a successful request.

You can create Company addresses without assigning them as billing or shipping addresses. However, Company users cannot use addresses at checkout without a billing or shipping designation.
