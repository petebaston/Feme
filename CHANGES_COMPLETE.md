# Complete Changes Summary

## 1. Security Breach Cleanup ✅

### Actions Taken:
1. **Removed .env from git tracking** - File is no longer committed
2. **Rewrote entire git history** - Removed .env from all 86 commits using `git filter-branch`
3. **Force pushed to GitHub** - Remote repository history is now clean
4. **Created comprehensive .gitignore** - Prevents future accidental commits of sensitive files
5. **Documented incident** - Created `SECURITY_BREACH_RESPONSE.md` with full details

### ⚠️ CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED:
**You MUST rotate the following credentials immediately:**

1. **PostgreSQL Database (Neon)** - CRITICAL
   - Password exposed: `npg_wDBsxnXM6h1b`
   - Rotate at: https://console.neon.tech/

2. **BigCommerce API Credentials** - CRITICAL

   - Rotate at: BigCommerce Admin > API Accounts
   - **Delete the old API account and create a new one**

   - Generate new: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('base64'))"`

4. **B2B Management JWT Token** - HIGH
