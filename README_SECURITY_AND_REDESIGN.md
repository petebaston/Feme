## üîê Security Work Completed

### 1. Git Repository Breach Cleanup ‚úÖ

**Issue**: `.env` file with sensitive credentials was committed to git history

**Actions Taken**:
- ‚úÖ Removed `.env` from git tracking
- ‚úÖ Rewrote entire git history (86 commits) using `git filter-branch`
- ‚úÖ Force pushed clean history to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Documented incident in `SECURITY_BREACH_RESPONSE.md`

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED**:
You MUST rotate these credentials immediately:
1. PostgreSQL database password (Neon)
2. BigCommerce API credentials (Client ID, Secret, Access Token)
3. Session secret
4. B2B Management JWT token

See `SECURITY_BREACH_RESPONSE.md` for detailed rotation instructions.

### 2. Multi-Tenant Security Vulnerability Audit ‚úÖ

**Issue**: Users can see ALL companies' orders/invoices, not just their own

**Severity**: üî¥ **CRITICAL**

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. ‚ùå No authentication middleware on data endpoints
2. ‚ùå No company-based authorization checks
3. ‚ùå No server-side data filtering by companyId
4. ‚ùå Dual token confusion (JWT vs BigCommerce token)
5. ‚ùå Missing role-based access control
6. ‚ùå No resource ownership verification

**Affected Endpoints**:
- `/api/orders` - All orders visible
- `/api/invoices` - All invoices visible
- `/api/quotes` - All quotes visible
- All other data endpoints

**Impact**:
- Complete breach of multi-tenancy
- Data exposure violation
- Potential GDPR/compliance issues
- Loss of customer trust

**Documentation**:
- `SECURITY_AUDIT.md` - Complete vulnerability analysis with code examples
- `SECURITY_FIX_PLAN.md` - Step-by-step implementation plan
